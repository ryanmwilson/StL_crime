# Crime trends in the city of St. Louis

This project aims to understand and classify crime trends in the city of St. Louis, MO, over the past decade (beginning in 2008).  It uses crime data from the St. Louis metropolitan police department and hourly weather data from NOAA.

### Directory structure 

The data are too large to include in this repository.  The raw data should be stored in a local `/raw_data` directory, with the subdirectories `stl_crime_data` and `stl_weather`.  Feel free to message me for access to data, if interested.

This is a work in progress - any comments are welcome!
